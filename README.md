**Pipex**

This as a project to learn the basics of pipe communication and infile outfile redirections.
To me it felt a bit like the predecessor of minishell. As a project it is fairly simple and a good introduction to ease your way into minishell.

To run: make and ./pipex "infile" "cmd1" "cmd2" "outfile"
